          I am an Informatics student passionate about web app development, data
          analytics and the exciting world of artificial intelligence. I really
          enjoy creating web applications, handling both the back and front
          ends. I also drawn to data analysis, data visualization, and machine
          learning. Python is my go-to programming language, and I have been
          using lots of its libraries like Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Django,
          Selenium, and Scikit-learn. I can also work with web languages like
          HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and I am currently learning frameworks React
          and Next.js. I use SQL to work with data, and Tableau or Power BI for
          creating visualizations. I got some little experience with Linux and
          have also worked with Microsoft Azure. I am a fast learner and love
          solving problems, always ready for new challenges to create
          user-friendly solutions. Lets team up and make your ideas come to
          life!
